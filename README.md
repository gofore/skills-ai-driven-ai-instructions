# Create an AI Constitution

Learn how to create high-context AI instruction files that ensure your AI assistants follow project standards.

## Welcome

- **Who is this for**: Developers looking to improve their collaboration with AI coding assistants.
- **What you'll learn**: You'll learn to identify, generate, and validate AI instruction files for different AI tools.
- **What you'll build**: You'll create a set of instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) for a sample project.
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub.
  - Access to an AI coding assistant like GitHub Copilot, Claude, or Cursor.
- **How long**: This exercise takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Understand the role of AI instruction files in AI-Driven Development.
2. Generate a comprehensive `AGENTS.md` file using an AI assistant.
3. Create instruction files for other AI tools that reference a central "source of truth".
4. Validate the instruction files with a GitHub Actions workflow.

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
