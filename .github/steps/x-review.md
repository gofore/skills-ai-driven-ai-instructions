Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- Created an `AGENTS.md` file to guide AI behavior.
- Defined key sections including Role, Tech Stack, Code Style, Architectural Decisions, and Communication.
- Configured the project to enforce these standards.

### What's next?

- Start using your AI assistant with these new instructions!
- Iterate on `AGENTS.md` as your project evolves and you discover new patterns.
- Share your configuration with your team to ensure consistency.
